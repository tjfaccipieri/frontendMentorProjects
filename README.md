# Frontend Mentor's Projects
This repository was created to put some frontendMentor's projects, used to study HTML/CSS/JS with some practical examples.
The printscrfeen of the projects will be put here as long as I finish a new one.
I'll work with just one big repo for this entire study project.
At every project, I'll try to put the focus points, problems and new things that I've lerned from them.
